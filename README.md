Cheating is the very first game I developed on my own using Python. The idea originally came from a mini-project in one of my major courses, where we had to create a game in Java as a team. Since the course was extremely challenging and had a heavy workload, we were determined to create something fun and engaging. However, due to time constraints, the final result fell short of our expectations.
As my coding skills improved and my passion for game development grew, I decided to give our original idea a second chance. By the time I revisited this project, a year had passed since that course. Back then, I primarily worked as an image editor, and I no longer had access to the original Java code. So instead of continuing from the old draft, I decided to rebuild the game from scratch using Pygame.
